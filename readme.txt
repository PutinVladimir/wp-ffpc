Fast Full Page Cache, backend can be memcached or APC

== Description ==
WP-FFPC is a full page cache plugin for WordPress. It can use APC or a memcached server as backend.
The naming stands for Fast Full Page Cache.

PHP has two extension for communication with a memcached server, named Memcache and Memcached. The plugin can utilize both, however, the recommended is memcached.

= Features: =
* exclude possibility of home, feeds, archieves, pages, singles
* use APC or memcached as backend
* 404 caching
* redirects caching
* Last Modified HTTP header compatibility with 304 responses
* shortlink HTTP header preservation
* pingback HTTP header preservation(1)
* fallback to no caching if any error or problem occurs
* Wordpress Network compatible(2)
* nginx compatible(3)
* (optional) syslog messages of sets-gets-flushes

(1) pingback hostname will always be generated from the accessed domain, otherwise speed would get highly compromised

(2) If used in WordPress Network, the configuration will only be available for network admins at the network admin panel, and will be system-wide and will be applied for every blog.

(3) nginx compatility means that if used with PHP Memcache or PHP Memcached extension, the created memcached entries can be read and served directly from nginx, making the cache insanely fast.
If used with APC, this feature is not available (no APC module for nginx), although, naturally, the cache modul is functional and working, but it will be done by PHP instead of nginx.
Short nginx example configuration is generated on the plugin settings page if Memcache or Memcached is selected as cache type.
NOTE: some features ( most of additional HTTP headers for example ) will not be available with this solution! ( yet )

Some parts were based on [Hyper Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache "Hyper Cache") plugin by Satollo (info@satollo.net).

== Installation ==
1. Upload contents of `wp-ffpc.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Enable WordPress cache by adding `define('WP_CACHE',true);` in wp-config.php
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress (please use network wide activation if used in a WordPress Network)
4. Fine tune the settings in `Settings` -> `wp-ffpc` menu in WordPress.
For WordPress Network, please visit the Network Admin panel, the options will be available under Network Admin Settings page, in WP-FFPC menu entry.

* long-running %3C bug fixed by the help of Mark Costlow <cheeks@swcp.com>, many thanks for it. It was cause by a bad check in the default values set-up: is_numeric applies for string numbers as well, which was unknown to me, and cause some of the values to be 0 where they should have been something different.

* binary mode is working correctly with memcached extension
* added warning message for memcache extension in binary mode
