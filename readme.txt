Store WordPress pages in memcached and serve them with nginx - unbeatable speed!

== Description ==
WP-FFPC is a full page cache plugin for WordPress. Supports memcached server or APC as backend and both widely available PHP memcached modules, Memcache and Memcached as well.

= Features: =
* exclude possibilities: of home, feeds, archieves, pages, singles
* possibility to enable caching for logged-in users
* APC or memcached server storage
* 404 caching
* redirects caching
* Last Modified HTTP header compatibility with 304 responses
* shortlink HTTP header preservation
* pingback HTTP header preservation(1)
* fallback to no caching if any error or problem occurs
* syslog & debug settings for troubleshooting
* supports multiple memcached backends
* Wordpress Network compatible(2)
* nginx compatible(3)

(1) pingback hostname will always be generated from the accessed domain, otherwise speed would get highly compromised

(2) If enabled as network-wide plugin in a WordPress Network, the configuration will only be available for network admins at the network admin panel, will be system-wide and will be applied for every blog.

(3) nginx compatility means that if used with PHP Memcache or PHP Memcached extension, the created memcached entries can be read and served directly from nginx.
If used with APC, this feature is not available (no APC module for nginx).
Short nginx example configuration is generated on the plugin settings page, under `nginx` tab according to the settings of the plugin.
NOTE: some features ( most of additional HTTP headers for example, like pingback, shortlink, etc. ) will not be available with this solution! ( yet )

Parts are based on [Hyper Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hyper-cache "Hyper Cache") plugin by Satollo (info@satollo.net).

== Installation ==
1. Upload contents of `wp-ffpc.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Enable WordPress cache by adding `define('WP_CACHE',true);` in wp-config.php
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress ( site or Network wide )
4. Check the settings in `Settings` ( site or Network Admin, depending on activation wideness ) -> `WP-FFPC` menu in WordPress.
5. Save the settings. THIS STEP IS MANDATORY: without saving the settings, there will be no activated caching!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to install memcache PHP extension? =
On most of the distributions, php5-memcached or php5-memcache is available as package.
You can use PECL alternatively: `pecl install memcached`.
It's recommended to use Memcached instead of Memcache.

= How to use the plugin on Amazon Linux? =
You have to remove the default yum package, named `php-pecl-memcache` and install `Memcache` or `Memcached` through PECL.

* long-running %3C bug fixed by the help of Mark Costlow <cheeks@swcp.com>, many thanks for it. It was cause by a bad check in the default values set-up: is_numeric applies for string numbers as well, which was unknown to me, and cause some of the values to be 0 where they should have been something different.

**KNOWN ISSUES**

There are major problems with the "memcache" driver, the source is yet unkown. The situation is that there's no response from the memcached server using this driver; please avoid using it!
